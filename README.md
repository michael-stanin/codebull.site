# CodeBull Teaser Site

Static marketing / teaser landing page for the upcoming CodeBull trading & bot platform for learning. Provides animated charts, feature overview, demo form, sample bot code highlight, leaderboard mock and contact capture (now persists via backend).

## Contact Form Backend Integration

Contact form submissions are now sent to a Node.js/Express backend and saved in `submissions.json`.

### How It Works

- The contact form sends submissions to `https://codebull-site-backend-c7a608525c7c.herokuapp.com/contact`.

## Roadmap Ideas

- Replace mock leaderboard with live API
- Real historical data integration
